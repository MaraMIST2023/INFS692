Data Science Final Project - Mara Elali

I was not able to get Models 1 and 2 to run without errors, so I was unable to knit them to .pdf. 
Model1_test is an accompanying file to Model1, where I attempted other things in trying to solve problems in the main file. 
I had a lot of trouble figuring out which packages were necessary for what, and likely included too many or too few 
in any one place. Durinhg renderingh, RStudio would hang and my computer would freeze, requiring restart which would empty the 
global environment, requiring me to run everything once more, which was very time consuming. This surprised meâ€”though my computer 
is old, I thought it performed well still. I might have to consider an upgrade. This was a very difficult project and I apologise 
for the messiness; it was all I could manage between another full term and continued illness.

Thank you.
